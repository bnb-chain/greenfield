# Billing and Payment

If you're interested in knowing the real-time pricing for storage and querying on Greenfield, we invite you to
the [Price Calculator](https://dcellar.io/pricing-calculator).

The fees are paid on Greenfield in the style of
`Stream` from users to Global Virtual Groups and Global Virtual Group Families at a constant rate.
The fees are charged every second as they are used.

## Concepts and Formulas

Streaming is a constant by-the-second movement of funds from a sending
account to a receiving account. Instead of sending payment transactions
now and then, Greenfield records the static balance, the latest update
timestamp, and flow rate in its payment module, and calculates the
dynamic balance with a formula using this data in the records. If the
net flow rate is not zero, the dynamic balance will change as time
elapses.

### Terminology

- **Payment Module:** This module is a special ledger system designed
  to manage billing and payments on the Greenfield blockchain.
  Funds will be deposited or charged into it from users' balance or
  payment accounts via the Payment Module;

- **Stream Account**: The Payment Module has its own ledger for
  billing management. Users can deposit and withdraw funds into
  their corresponding "accounts" on the payment module ledger. These
  accounts are called `Stream Account`, which will directly interact
  with the stream payment functions and bill the users for the
  storage and data service;

- **Payment Account**: Payment account has been discussed in other
  sections of Part 1 and Part 3 already. It is actually a type of
  Stream Account. Users can create different payment accounts and
  associate it with different buckets for different purposes;

- **Payment Stream:** Whenever the users add, delete or change a storage
  object or download a data package, they add or change one or more
  `payment streams` for that service provided by SPs;

- **Flow Rate**: The per-second rate at which a sender decreases its
  net outflow stream and increases a receiver's net inflow stream
  when creating or updating a payment stream;

- **Netflow Rate**: The per-second rate that an account's balance is
  changing. It is the sum of the account's inbound and outbound
  flow rates;

- **Sender**: The stream account that starts the payment stream by
  specifying a receiver and a flow rate at which its net flow
  decreases;

- **Receiver**: The stream account on the receiving end of one or more payment streams.

- **CRUD Timestamp**: The timestamp that indicates when a user
  creates, updates, or deletes a payment stream;

- **Delta Balance**: The amount of the stream account's balance that has
  changed since the latest CRUD timestamp due to the flow. It can be
  positive or negative;

- **Static Balance**: The balance of the stream account at the latest
  CRUD timestamp;

- **Dynamic Balance**: The actual balance of a stream account. It is
  the sum of the Static Balance and the Delta Balance.

When a user's stream account is initiated in the payment module by
deposit, several fields will be recorded for this stream account:

- **CRUD Timestamp** - will be the timestamp at the time;

- **Static Balance** - will be the deposit amount;

- **Netflow Rate** - will be 0;

- **Buffer Balance** - will be 0.

### Formula

*<span style={{color:'#6495ED'}}>Static Balance</span> = Initial Balance at latest CRUD timestamp*

*<span style={{color:'#556B2F'}}>Delta Balance</span> = Netflow Rate \* Seconds elapsed since latest CRUD timestamp*

*<span style={{color:'#CD5C5C'}}>Current Balance</span> = <span style={{color:'#6495ED'}}>Static Balance</span> + <span style={{color:'#556B2F'}}>Delta Balance</span>*

*<span style={{color:'#FFDEAD'}}>Buffer Balance</span> = - Netflow Rate \* pre-configured ReserveTime if Netflow Rate is negative*

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><i>How a User Receives Inflow and Outflow of Funds</i></div>


Every time a user creates, updates, or deletes a payment stream, many
variables in the above formulas will be updated and the users' stream accounts in the
payment module will be settled.

- The net flow for the user's stream account in the payment module
  will be re-calculated to net all of its inbound and outbound flow
  rates by adding/removing the new payment stream against the
  current NetFlow Rate. (E.g. when a user creates a new object whose
  price is \$0.4/month, its NetFlow Rate will add -\$0.4/month);

- If the NetFlow rate is negative, the associated amount of BNB will
  be reserved in a buffer balance. It is used to avoid the dynamic
  balance becoming negative. When the dynamic balance becomes under
  the threshold, the account will be forced settled;

- CRUD Timestamp will become the current timestamp;

- Static Balance will be re-calculated. The previous dynamic balance
  will be settled. The new static Balance will be the Current
  Balance plus the change of the Buffer Balance.

## Key Workflow

### Deposit and Withdrawal

All users can deposit and withdraw BNB in the payment
module. The `StaticBalance` in the `StreamRecord` data struct will be
"settled" first: the `CRUDTimeStamp` will be updated and `StaticBalance`
will be netted with `DeltaBalance`. Then the deposit and withdrawal number
will try to add/reduce the `StaticBalance` in the record. If the static
balance is less than the withdrawal amount, the withdrawal will fail. If
the withdrawal amount is equal to or greater than 100BNB, it will be 
timelock-ed for 1 day duration.

Deposit and withdrawal via cross-chain will also be supported to enable
users to deposit and withdraw from BSC directly.

Specifically, the payment deposit can be triggered automatically during
the creation of objects or the addition of data packages. As long as
users have assets in their address accounts and payment accounts, the
payment module may directly charge the users by moving the funds from
address accounts.

### Payment Stream

Payment streams are flowing in one direction. Whenever the users deposit
from their address accounts into the stream accounts (including users'
default stream account and created payment accounts), the funds first go
from the users' address accounts to a system account maintained by the
Payment Module, although the fund size and other payment parameters will
be recorded on the users' stream account, i.e. the `StreamRecord` record,
in the Payment Module ledger. When the payment is settled, the funds
will go from the system account to Global Virtual Groups' or Global Virtual
Group Families' virtual funding addresses according to
their in-flow calculation.

Every time users do the actions below, their `StreamRecord` will
be updated:

- Creating an object will create new streams to the Global Virtual Groups
  and Global Virtual Group Family;

- Deleting an object will delete associated streams to the Global Virtual Groups
  and Global Virtual Group Family;

- Adjusting the read quota will
  create/delete/update the associated streams.

### Forced Settlement

If a user doesn't deposit for a long time, his previous deposit may be
all used up for the stored objects. Greenfield has a forced settlement
mechanism to ensure enough funds are secured for further service fees.

There are two configurations, `ReserveTime` and `ForcedSettleTime`.

Let's take an example where the `ReserveTime` is 7 days and the `ForcedSettleTime` is 1 day.
If a user wants to store an object at the price of
approximately $0.1 per month($0.00000004/second), he must reserve fees
for 7 days in the buffer balance, which is `$0.00000004 * 7 * 86400 =
$0.024192`. If the user deposits is $1 initially, the stream payment
record will be as below:

- **CRUD Timestamp**: 100;

- **Static Balance**: $0.975808;

- **Netflow Rate**: -$0.00000004/sec;

- **Buffer Balance**: $0.024192.

After 10000 seconds, the dynamic balance of the user will be `0.975808 - 10000 * 0.00000004 = 0.975408`.

After 24395200 seconds(approximately 282 days), the dynamic balance of
the user will become negative. Users should have some alarms for such
events that remind them to supply more funds in time.

If no more funds are supplied and the dynamic balance plus buffer
balance is under the forced settlement threshold, the account will be
forcibly settled. All payment streams of the account will be closed and
the account will be marked as out of balance. The download speed for all
objects associated with the account or payment account will be
downgraded. The objects will be deleted by the SPs if no fund is
provided within the predefined threshold.

The forced settlement will also charge some fees which is another
incentive for users to replenish funds proactively.

Let's say the `ForceSettlementTime` variable is set to 1 day. After 24913601
seconds(approximately 288 days), the dynamic balance becomes `0.975808 -
24913601 *0.00000004 = -0.02073604`, plus the buffer balance is
$0.00345596. The forced settlement threshold is `86400* 0.00000004 =
0.003456`. The forced settlement will be triggered, and the record of the
user will become as below:

- **CRUD Timestamp**: 24913701;

- **Static Balance**: \$0;

- **Netflow Rate**: \$0/sec;

- **Buffer Balance**: \$0.

The validators will get the remaining $0.00345596 as a reward. The
account will be marked as "frozen" and his objects get downgraded
by SPs.

Every time a stream record is updated, Greenfield calculates the time
when the account will be out of balance. So Greenfield can keep an
on-chain list to trace the timestamps for the potential forced
settlement. The list will be checked by the end of every block
processing. When the block time passes the forced settlement timestamp,
the settlement of the associated stream accounts will be triggered
automatically. There is another parameter `MaxAutoSettleFlowCount` controls
how many outflows (not `StreamRecord`) will be force settled in a block.

For example, when `MaxAutoSettleFlowCount` is 10, and a `StreamRecord` has 15
outflows, it will take 2 blocks to totally force settle the record, and in the
first block, the account will be marked as "frozen".

### Payment Account

Payment account is a special "Stream Account" type in the Payment
Module. Users can create multiple payment accounts and have the
permission to link buckets to different payment accounts to pay for
storage and data package.

The payment accounts have the below traits:

- Every user can create multiple payment accounts. The payment
  accounts created by the user are recorded with a map on the
  Greenfield blockchain.

- The address format of the payment account is the same as normal
  accounts. It's derived by the hash of the user address and
  payment account index. The payment account only exists in the
  storage payment module. Users can deposit into, withdraw from and
  query the balance of payment accounts in the payment module, which
  means payment accounts cannot be used for transfer or staking.

- Users can only associate their buckets with their payment accounts
  to pay for storage and bandwidth. Users cannot associate their own
  buckets with others' payment accounts, and users cannot associate
  others' buckets with their own payment accounts.

- The owner of a payment account is the user who creates it. The owner
  can set it non-refundable. It's a one-way setting and can not be
  revoked. Thus, users can set some objects as "public goods" which
  can receive donations for storage and bandwidth while preserving
  the ownership.

### Account Freeze and Resume

If a payment account is out of balance, it will be settled and set a
flag as out of balance.

The `NetflowRate` will be set to 0, while the current settings of the
stream pay will be backed up in another data structure. The download
speed for all objects under this account will be downgraded.

If someone deposits BNB tokens into a frozen account and the static balance is
enough for reserved fees, the account will be resumed automatically. The
stream pay will be recovered from the backup. Usually, when user deposits to his
payment account, the payment account will be "active" quickly. However, if there
are many outflows associated to the payment account, the payment account will be
queued for resume and handled in the following blocks. There is a parameter
`MaxAutoResumeFlowCount` designed for this. For example, when `MaxAutoResumeFlowCount`
is 10, if a user wants to resume a payment account with 5 outflows, the payment account
will be "active" immediately, and if a user wants to resume a payment account with 15
outflow, it will take two blocks and finally the payment account will be "active".

During the `OutOfBalance` period, no objects can be associated with this
payment account again, which results in no object can be created under
the bucket associated with the account.

If the associated object is deleted, the backup stream pay settings will
be changed accordingly to ensure it reflects the latest once the account
is resumed.

### Storage Fee Price and Adjustment

The cost of **object storage fee** and **data package fee** are composed of 3 parts:

- The primary SP will store the whole object file;
- The secondary SPs will store part of the object file as a replica;
- The primary SP will supply all the download requests of the object.

Hence, there are 3 different on-chain prices globally, which are used to charge storage 
and download:

- Primary SP Store Price;
- Primary SP Read Price;
- Secondary SP Store Price.

Every SP can set their own suggested store price and read price via on-chain transactions.
At the first block of each month, the median all SPs' store prices will be calculated as 
the Primary SP Store Price, the Secondary SP Store Price will be calculated as a proportion 
of the Primary SP Store Price (e.g. 12%, which can be governed), and the median of all SPs' 
read prices will be calculated as the Primary SP Read Price.

To make the global prices predictable to users and avoid price war, during the last two days 
of a month all SPs are not allowed to set their own suggested prices.

The unit of price is a decimal, which indicates wei BNB per byte per second.
E.g. the price is 0.027, means approximately $0.022 / GB / Month.
(`0.027 * (30 * 86400) * (1024 * 1024 * 1024) * 300 / 10 ** 18 ≈ 0.022`, assume the BNB price is 300 USD)

The storage fees are calculated and charged in bucket level.
The primary store price, secondary store price, and primary read price are stored in the chain state 
and the same for all buckets at a specific time.
The total size of all objects and per Global Virtual Group served size in a bucket will be recorded in the bucket
metadata.
The charge size will be used instead of the real size, e.g. files under 1KB will be charged as 1KB to cover the cost.
The payment bill will be calculated by the size statistics and prices, and it will be charged from
the stream account specified in the bucket to the Global Virtual Groups and Global Virtual Group family.

## Payment States

The payment module keeps state of the following primary objects:

- The stream payment ledger;
- The payment accounts and total account created by users;
- An AutoSettleRecord list to keep track of the auto-settle timestamp of the stream accounts.

In addition, the payment module keeps the following indexes to manage the aforementioned state:

- StreamRecord Index. `address -> StreamRecord`;
- OutFlow Index. `address -> OutFlow`;
- PaymentAccount Index. `address -> PaymentAccount`;
- PaymentAccountCount Index. `address -> PaymentAccountCount`;
- AutoSettleRecord Index. `settle-timestamp | address -> 0`.
- AutoResumeRecord Index. `resume-timestamp | address -> 0`.

## Payment Module Parameters

The payment module contains the following parameters,
they can be updated with governance. The `VersionedParams` will keep track of
all versions of `ReserveTime` and `ValidatorTaxRate`.

```

## Payment Module Keepers

The payment module keeper provides access to query the parameters,
payment account owner, storage price and several ways to update the ledger.

Currently, it's only used by the storage module.

```
type PaymentKeeper interface {
	GetParams(ctx sdk.Context) paymenttypes.Params
	IsPaymentAccountOwner(ctx sdk.Context, addr string, owner string) bool
	GetStoragePrice(ctx sdk.Context, params paymenttypes.StoragePriceParams) (price paymenttypes.StoragePrice, err error)
	ApplyFlowChanges(ctx sdk.Context, from string, flowChanges []paymenttypes.OutFlow) (err error)
	ApplyUserFlowsList(ctx sdk.Context, userFlows []paymenttypes.UserFlows) (err error)
	UpdateStreamRecordByAddr(ctx sdk.Context, change *paymenttypes.StreamRecordChange) (ret *paymenttypes.StreamRecord, err error)
}
```

## Messages

### MsgCreatePaymentAccount

Used to create new payment account for a user.

```
message MsgCreatePaymentAccount {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";

  // creator is the address of the stream account that created the payment account
  string creator = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
}
```

### MsgDeposit

Used to deposit BNB tokens to a stream account.

```
message MsgDeposit {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";

  // creator is the message signer for MsgDeposit and the address of the account to deposit from
  string creator = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
  // to is the address of the account to deposit to
  string to = 2 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
  // amount is the amount to deposit
  string amount = 3 [
    (cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.Int",
    (gogoproto.customtype) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Int",
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false
  ];
}
```

### MsgWithdraw

Used to withdraw BNB tokens from a stream account.

When the withdrawal amount is too large (i.e. equal to or greater than `withdraw_time_lock_threshold`, which is defined
as a payment parameter), the withdrawal will be timelock-ed for a specific duration (i.e. `withdraw_time_lock_duration`
seconds, which is also defined as a payment parameter), and after the duration the user can withdraw the locked amount
by sending a message without `from` field. For example, on testnet, when withdrawal amount is equal to or greater than
100 BNB, the withdrawal will be locked for 1 day duration.

```
message MsgWithdraw {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";

  // creator is the message signer for MsgWithdraw and the address of the receive account
  string creator = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
  // from is the address of the account to withdraw from
  string from = 2 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
  // amount is the amount to withdraw
  string amount = 3 [
    (cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.Int",
    (gogoproto.customtype) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Int",
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false
  ];
}
```

### MsgDisableRefund

Used to make a stream account non-refundable.

```
message MsgDisableRefund {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "owner";

  // owner is the message signer for MsgDisableRefund and the address of the payment account owner
  string owner = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
  // addr is the address of the payment account to disable refund
  string addr = 2 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
}
```

### MsgSetBucketFlowRateLimit

Used to set the flow rate limit for a bucket.

```
message MsgSetBucketFlowRateLimit {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "operator";

  // operator defines the account address of the operator, either the object owner or the updater with granted permission.
  string operator = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
  // bucket_name defines the name of the bucket
  string bucket_name = 2;
  // bucket_owner defines the account address of the bucket owner
  string bucket_owner = 3 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
  // payment_address defines an account address to pay the fee for the bucket.
  string payment_address = 4 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
  // flow_rate_limit defines the flow rate limit of the bucket
  string flow_rate_limit = 5 [
    (cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.Int",
    (gogoproto.customtype) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Int",
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false
  ];
}
```

## Related Storage Key Workflows

### Create Bucket

When creating object, the **data package** can be defined by the bucket owner.
If the **data package** is not zero, there will be two outflows created for the payment account.

- the outflow going to Global Virtual Group Family will be created for read fee
- the outflow going to validator tax pool will be created for extra validator tax fee

### Update Bucket

The bucket owner can update the **data package** of his bucket, e.g., increasing the read quota.
Then the outflow will be updated to reflect the new quota.

- the outflow which goes to Global Virtual Group Family will be updated
- the outflow which goes to validator tax pool will be updated

The bucket owner can also assign new payment account to his bucket. In such case,

- old payment account's outflow which goes to the Global Virtual Group Family will be decreased or removed
- old payment account's outflow which goes to validator tax pool will be decreased or removed
- new payment accounts' outflow going to Global Virtual Group Family will be created for read fee
- new payment accounts' outflow going to validator tax pool will be created for extra validator tax fee

Be noted, if read fee or store fee has been changed (e.g., the primary sp updated its read fee), during updating bucket,
it will also recalculate the store fee for all objects in the bucket. After updating bucket,
the bucket need to pay using the new price for both **object storage fee** and **data package fee**.

### Delete Bucket

When deleting a bucket, there should be no object in it. The related outflows will be updated,

- the outflow which goes to the Global Virtual Group Family will be decreased or removed
- the outflow which goes to validator tax pool will be decreased or removed

### Set Bucket Flow Rate Limit

If the flow rate limit set for a bucket is less than the current flow rate, the related outflows will be updated,

- the outflow which goes to the Global Virtual Group Family will be decreased to 0 or removed
- the outflow which goes to validator tax pool will be decreased to 0 or removed

### Create Object

When creating an object which is not empty, there will be not outflow change for the bucket's payment account.
However, some amount of BNB will be locked to make sure the payment account has enough BNB for storing the object
for at least `ReserveTime` long.

The locked fee is calculated as below:

```
	primaryRate = PrimaryStorePrice * ChargeSize
	secondaryRate = SecondaryStorePrice * ChargeSize * SecondaySPNumber
	validatorTaxRate = ValidatorTaxRate * (primaryRate + secondaryRate)

	totalRate = primaryRate + secondaryRate + validatorTaxRate
	lockAmount = totalRate * ReserveTime
```

The `ChargeSize` is calculated from the object's payload size, if the payload size is less than **128KB** then `ChargeSize` is **128KB**, otherwise `ChargeSize` is equal to payload size.

:::note
To optimize your cost, it is advisable to consolidate small files into payloads exceeding **128KB**. Failing to do so may result in higher charges.
:::

### Seal Object

When creating an object which is empty, it will be sealed directly.


When sealing object, the locked fee will be moved from lock balance to buffer balance and the following outflows will be
created for the payment account.

- the outflow going to Global Virtual Group Family will be created for primary store fee
- the outflow going to Global Virtual Group will be created for secondary store fee
- the outflow going to validator tax pool will be created for extra validator tax fee

Be noted, if read fee or store fee has been changed (e.g., the primary sp updated its read fee), during sealing object,
it will also recalculate the read fee and the store fee for all objects in the bucket. After sealing object,
the bucket need to pay using the new price for both **object storage fee** and **data package fee**.
