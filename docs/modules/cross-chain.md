# Cross Chain

The real power of the Greenfield ecosystem lies in that the platform is not only designed to store the data, but also to
support the creation of value based on the data assets and its related economy.

The asset traits of the data are firstly established on the permissions, e.g. the permission to read the data. When 
this right is disconnected from the data itself, they become tradable assets and enlarge the value of the data. This 
can be amplified when the data itself can be executable (a new type of "Smart Code"), interact with each other, and 
generate new data. This creates a lot of room to imagine building a new, data-intensive, trustless computing environment.

Secondly, the data permissions can be transferred cross-chain onto BSC and become digital assets there. This creates a 
variety of possibilities to integrate these assets with the existing DeFi protocols and models on BSC.

This gets even further enhanced by the smart contracts on BSC, which enjoy the same address format as accounts on the 
Greenfield blockchain and can be the owners of the data objects and inherit different permissions. This will unleash 
many new business opportunities based on the data and its operations.

## Cross-Chain with BSC

The cross-chain model expects to achieve the following goals:

- integratable with the existing systems: try to reuse the current
  infrastructure and dApps as much as possible, such as NFT
  Marketplace, data indexing, and blockchain explorers.

- programmable: dApps can define how they want to wrap the assets from Greenfield.

- secure and recoverable.

The native cross-chain bridge is maintained and secured by the
validators of Greenfield, via a new relayer system based on an
aggregated multisig scheme (more details in the later sections).
Greenfield validators will run the relayers to facilitate the high
bandwidth and fast bridge.

BNB will be transferred from BSC to Greenfield as the first cross-chain
action. The initial validator set of Greenfield at the genesis will
first lock a certain amount of BNB into the "Greenfield Token Hub"
contract on BSC. This contract will also be used as part of the native
bridge for BNB transferring after the genesis. These initial locked BNB
will be used as the self-stake of validators and early days gas fees.

## Framework

<div align="center"><i>Figure Cross-chain Architecture</i></div>

The bottom layer is a cross-chain **Communication Layer**, which focuses
on primitive communication package handling and verification. The middle
layer implements the **Resource Mirror**. It is responsible for managing
the resource assets that are defined on Greenfield but mirrored onto
BSC. The top layer is the **Application Layer**, which are the smart
contracts implemented by community developers on BSC to operate the
mirrored resource entities with their primitives; Greenfield does not have
such an application layer since itself does not provide programmability yet.
The real dApps will have some part in this Application Layer and also
interact with Greenfield Core and all sorts of supporting infrastructures.

Because of the asymmetric framework, BSC focuses more on the
application/control plane, while Greenfield is the data plane. To avoid
state racing, the following rules are introduced:

- Any resources that are initiated to create by BSC can only be controlled by BSC.

- Any resources that are controlled by BSC can not transfer control rights to Greenfield.

- Any resources that are controlled by Greenfield can transfer control rights to BSC.

## Communication Layer

The communication layer is composed of a set of **Greenfield Relayers**:

- Each validator should run a relayer. Each relayer possesses a BLS
  private key, with the address of the key stored on-chain as part
  of the validator's mandatory information.

- The relayer watches all cross-chain events happen on BSC and the
  Greenfield blockchain independently. After enough blocks of
  confirmation to reach finality, the relayer will sign a message by
  the BLS key to confirm the events, and broadcast the signing
  attestment, which is called "the vote", through a p2p network to
  other relayers.

- Once enough votes from the relayer are collected, the relayer will
  assemble a cross-chain package transaction and submit it to BSC or
  Greenfield network.

## Resource Mirror Layer

### Resource Entity Mirror

The purposes of almost all the cross-chain packages are to change the
state of the resource entities on the Greenfield blockchain. Thus the
below resource entities should be able to be mirrored on BSC:

1. Account

2. BNB

3. Bucket

4. Object

5. Group

The account mapping is natural: as BSC and Greenfield use the same
address scheme. The same address values on both sides mean the same
account. They do not require an actual mirror.

BNB is a natively pegged token from the genesis of Greenfield. The
"Token Hub" contract is a smart contract built on BSC to ensure
that Greenfield cannot inflate BNB and secure the total circulation of
BNB.

Bucket, Object, and Group are mirrored onto BSC as NFTs of a new BEP
revised from the ERC-721 standard. These NFTs have corresponding
metadata information for the resources. The ownerships of the NFTs on
BSC stand for the ownerships of these resources on Greenfield. As these
ownerships are not transferable on Greenfield, these NFTs are not
transferable on BSC.

### Cross-Chain Operating Primitives

A few series of cross-chain primitives are defined for dApps to call to
operate on these resource entities.

It is worth highlighting that smart contracts can call these primitives
in a similar way as EOAs.

Accounts

- create payment accounts on BSC

BNB:

- transfer bidirectionally between BSC and Greenfield among accounts
  (including even payment accounts)

Bucket:

- create a bucket on BSC

- mirror bucket from Greenfield to BSC

Object:

- mirror object from Greenfield to BSC

- create an object on BSC

- grant/revoke permissions of objects on BSC to accounts/groups

- copy objects on BSC

- Kick off the execution of an object on BSC

- associate buckets to payment accounts on BSC

Group:

- mirror group from Greenfield to BSC

- create a group on BSC

- change group members on BSC

- leave a group on BSC

Once these primitives are called by EOA or smart contracts, the
predefined events will be emitted. Greenfield Relayers should pick up
these events and relay them over to Greenfield and BSC. As the change
will happen asynchronously, there will be specific cross-chain packages
for acknowledgments or errors, which can trigger a callback. The caller
of the primitives should pay the fees upfront for cross-chain operations
and also for the potential callback. More details are discussed in Part 3.
