# Greenfield blockchain events

There are two types of events doc:
1. Some old modules introduced in the cosmos-sdk don't emit typed events.
   Their events are listed in a Markdown document under the module's spec folder.
2. The new modules introduced in the cosmos-sdk or developed by the Greenfield
   team emit typed events. Their typed events are defined in a protobuf file.
   For these modules, we can refer to their protobuf file directly.

Following are the events that the Greenfield blockchain emits, grouped by modules:
