# Payment

## Abstract

The payment module is responsible for the payment of the greenfield network. It is mainly used to manage the payment account of the user, and the payment account is used to pay the storage fee. The payment module also provides the function of automatic settlement of the user's payment account.

You can refer to the [billing and payment section](../../guide/greenfield-blockchain/modules/billing-and-payment.md) for more details.

## Quick Start

### Create Payment Account

To create a new payment account, `create-payment-account` can be used.

```shell
gnfd tx payment create-payment-account --from ${key} --node ${node} -y
```

${key} is the name of local key.

${node} is the rpc address of a Greenfield node.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
defaultValue="mainnet"
values={[
{label: 'Mainnet', value: 'mainnet'},
{label: 'Testnet', value: 'testnet'},
]}>
<TabItem value="mainnet">

	node = "https://greenfield-chain.bnbchain.org:443"

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="testnet">

	node = "https://gnfd-testnet-fullnode-tendermint-us.bnbchain.org:443"

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Query Payment Account

After the payment account is created, you can query all your payment accounts via the following command:

```shell
gnfd q payment get-payment-accounts-by-owner ${owner} --node ${node}
```
${owner} is the owner address you want to query, usually it is the address derived from your key.

To query the details of a payment account, the following command can be executed.

```shell
gnfd q payment show-payment-account ${payment_account_addr} --node ${node}
```
${payment_account_addr} is the address of the payment account you want to query.

### Deposit to Payment Account

To deposit to a payment amount, the amount should be provided as the following command.

```shell
gnfd tx payment deposit ${payment_account_addr} ${amount} --from ${key} --node ${node} -y
```

${amount} defines the BNB amount you want to deposit, e.g., `1000000000000000000`.

### Withdraw from Payment Account

To withdraw from a payment amount, the following command can be used.

```shell
gnfd tx payment withdraw ${payment_account_addr} ${amount} --from ${key} --node ${node} -y
```

${amount} defines the BNB amount you want to withdraw, e.g., `1000000000000000000`.

### Disable Refundable

After disabling withdrawal of payment account, which cannot be reverted, the owner cannot withdraw from the payment account. 

```shell
gnfd tx payment disable-refund ${payment_account_addr} --from ${key} -y
```
