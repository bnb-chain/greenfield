# Greenfield

![banner](./asset/static/banner.png)

Official Golang implementation of the Greenfield Blockchain. It uses [tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/)
for consensus and build on [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

BNB Greenfield aims to facilitate the decentralized data economy by simplifying the process of storing and managing data
access, as well as linking data ownership with the massive DeFi context of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

BNB Greenfield operates through three core components, which distinguish it from existing centralized and decentralized
storage systems::
- It enables Ethereum-compatible addresses to create and manage data and token assets seamlessly.
- It natively links data permissions and management logic onto BSC as exchangeable assets and smart contract programs,
thereby providing developers with a more efficient and flexible way of managing their data and permissions.
- It provides similar API primitives and performance as popular existing Web2 cloud storage systems.

These features offer a novel and innovative approach to decentralized data management and ownership in the DeFi space.
Overall, BNB Greenfield presents a promising solution for bringing greater flexibility, control, and efficiency to users
in the decentralized data economy.

## Greenfield Core

The center of BNB Greenfield are two layers:
1. A new storage-oriented blockchain, and
2. network composed of "storage providers".

This repo is the official implementation of Greenfield blockchain. 

The blockchain of BNB Greenfield serves a dual purpose of maintaining the ledger for users as well as the storage metadata
as common blockchain state data. The blockchain has its native token, BNB, which is transferred from the Binance Smart Chain,
and is utilized for gas and governance functionalities. Governance is further enabled through the staking logic that is
unique to the BNB Greenfield blockchain.

The Greenfield blockchain has two categories of states that are stored on-chain:

1. The ledger of accounts and their BNB balance

2. The metadata of the object storage system and service providers, along with the metadata of the objects stored on the
storage system, permission and billing information pertaining to the storage system.

Transactions on the Greenfield blockchain have the ability to modify the aforementioned on-chain states. These states and
the transactions that affect them are at the core of the economic data on the BNB Greenfield platform.

Users looking to create or access data on Greenfield may do so by engaging with the BNB Greenfield Core Infrastructure
through decentralized applications known as BNB Greenfield dApps. These dApps provide a user-friendly interface for
interacting with the platform, enabling users to create and manipulate data in a secure and decentralized environment.

## Quick Started

*Note*: Requires [Go 1.18+](https://go.dev/dl/)

```
## Build from source
make build

## start a private network with 3 validators and 3 storage providers
$ bash ./deployment/localup/localup.sh all  3 3

## query the key of the first validator
$ ./build/bin/gnfd keys list --home   $(pwd)/deployment/localup/.local/validator0   --keyring-backend test

## get the balance of an account
$ addr=`./build/bin/gnfd keys list --home   $(pwd)/deployment/localup/.local/validator0   --keyring-backend test|grep address|awk '{print $3}'`
$ ./build/bin/gnfd q bank balances $addr  --node tcp://127.0.0.1:26750 

## send BNB
$ ./build/bin/gnfd tx bank send validator0 0x73a4Cf67b46D7E4efbb95Fc6F59D64129299c2E3 100000000000000000000BNB --from validator0 -y --node tcp://127.0.0.1:26750 --home $(pwd)/deployment/localup/.local/validator0 --keyring-backend test  --broadcast-mode block

## stop the private chain
$ bash ./deployment/localup/localup.sh stop 

## restart the private chain
bash ./deployment/localup/localup.sh start 3 3
```

More advanced script and command line usage, please refer to the [Tutorial](docs/cli/cli.md).

## Key Modules

- `x/bridge`: provide the cross-chain token transfer function, enabling BNB to flow freely between Greenfield and BSC
network with native support.
- `x/challenge`: generate random data challenge events or accept user's data challenge requests.
- `x/payment`: handle the billing and payment of the storage module. User fees are paid through "Stream" on Greenfield,
with a constant rate of payment from users to Storage Providers (SP) with charges applied every second of usage.
- `x/sp`: manage the various storage providers within the network.
- `x/storage`: users can manage their storage data through this module, like create/delete bucket, create/delete storage object.
- `x/permission`: user can manage its resource permission through this module, like put/delete policy for storage object.

And the following modules are in cosmos-sdk:

- `x/crosschain`: manage the cross chain packages, like store/query/update the cross chain package, channels, sequences.
- `x/gashub`: provide a governable and predictable fee charge mechanism.
- `x/oracle`: provide a secure runtime for cross chain packages.
- `x/staking`:  based on the Proof-of-Stake logic. The elected validators are responsible for the security of the Greenfield blockchain. 
They get involved in the governance and staking of the blockchain.

Refer to the [docs](docs/readme.md) to dive deep into these modules.
